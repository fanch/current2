  <h1 style="text-align: justify;">A Warm NuTyX Welcome To All</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I am Thierry Nuttens, the Chief
      Administrator and Founder of the NuTyX System. I am Swiss French and
      bilingual. NuTyX is a complete GNU/Linux distribution incorporating
      performance and flexibility, it is based on the Linux From Scratch books <a
        href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/">LFS</a> and <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/">BLFS</a>.
      We recommend you to have some knowledge about the GNU/Linux system. NuTyX
      is an excellent operating system for persons who want to commit themselves
      in developing their skills further and learn how a Linux system is fused
      together. NuTyX is a binary distribution optimized for architectures i686
      and x86_64. It is up to you in deciding whether to use the ports system of
      installing your own source packages, - (which requires compiling!) or just
      be content with the binary packages that are natively integrated into the
      system. NuTyX offers the KDE and&nbsp; XFCE graphical interfaces in
      binary.</p>
    <h2>The 10 benefits of NuTyX</h2>
    <ol>
      <li style="text-align: justify;">The ability to be installed from almost
        any other distribution, thanks to the BASH script located at
        http://downloads.nutyx.org/install-saravane. this can be downloaded,
        study it carefully to see what it will do, then launch it from the host
        distribution. Briefly, the script will check for all the necessary
        tools, then start the download of a minimal set of packages and finally,
        install them in the location you specified. Details and explanations are
        found in http://www.nutyx.org/en/generate-iso.html.</li>
      <li style="text-align: justify;">It has a Maintenance program which allows
        you full access to rectify your system in cases of complete system
        failure. The NuTyX maintenance program has ability to able to erase,
        format, modify (as the file system is not mounted) partition, and also
        re-install the system and the Grub boot-loader.</li>
      <li style="text-align: justify;">It has the ability of using a very simple
        syntax program that uses a method called <b>porting</b> which downloads
        a package/s from our repositories. The program is very similar to the
        one used by CRUX, it can be written in less then 10 lines. It can also
        sort and apply all Dependencies if needed. Instead of the script, you
        can also use the binary package manager to download and install your
        packages.</li>
      <li style="text-align: justify;">It has the ability, once installed to
        easily alter and produce a personalized live version of NuTyX. The new
        live version can also be re-installed on other machines, should you so
        desire.</li>
      <li style="text-align: justify;">It has the ability, to allow you
        installation of a complete base binary package or a selection of
        individual base binary packages. For example: devel, man, doc and lib.</li>
      <li style="text-align: justify;">It has no need of a separate HDD or
        partition. The NuTyX installer creates a virtual environment and
        therefore is able to install/re-install without formatting the target
        disk or partition.</li>
      <li style="text-align: justify;">It has unique installation coding, that
        disallows the NuTyX installer to FORMAT the target partition. This means
        that NuTyX can be installed on a partition containing data: (for
        example) personal files and various non-system folders.</li>
      <li style="text-align: justify;">It has a very powerful, yet a simple
        command which allow you to return to the base system and change
        completely the X graphical interface (from KDE to XFCE). This also allow
        you not having to reinstall or download every package again. The
        downloaded packages and updates will be simply be reinstalled
        automatically.</li>
      <li style="text-align: justify;">It has a totally unique package manager
        for the needs of NuTyX. It's made of expandable modules. No dependencies
        (beside glibc) are needed. One of its strong points is the ability to
        discover binary dependencies automatically.</li>
      <li style="text-align: justify;">It has the ability to compile all the
        packages properly per level on a dedicated chroot environment. After
        compilation, all the dependencies are again checked to make sure no
        broken links are found.</li>
    </ol>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">NuTyX offers the GNOME, MATE, LXDE, LXQT, KDE, KF5 and XFCE GUI in binaries.</p>
