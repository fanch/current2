 <h1><span>Why should you contribute ?</span></h1>
<div class="introduction">Today NuTyX have about <a href="packages.html" title="Read in another windows" class="external" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;">1500 applications</a> in binaries available. It's a lot and not because every days are new programs release on the net under open source licence (or not)</div>
<div class="description"><p>It's clear, you will never have the chance to see all thoses programs ready to be installed on NuTyX. Just with the web site <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">sourceforge.net</a>,  we can find more then 5000 applications for all platforms. If you found the application of yours dreams, you will have in eather way to compile it, install it and make it working on NuTyX. That why we will ask you to contribute a little bit. It's you who will build the package... if you want of course.</p>
<p>Compiling an application is often something like:</p>
<ul><li>Find the application that doen't exist on NuTyX</li></ul>
<ul><li>Download the sources of the application</li></ul>
<ul><li>Check the MD5SUM (strongly recommended but not always possible)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Extract sources in a working directory</li></ul>
<ul><li>Enter in this working directory</li></ul>
<ul><li>Check that all the dependencies exists in NuTyX so that the compilation endup with succes</li></ul>
<ul><li>Type the three magic commands (not always the case)</li></ul>
<pre class="output">./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make install</pre>
<p>That's it you new program is compiled and install on your NuTyX.</p>
<p>That's one way to go... but as you can see they are a few disadvantages:</p>
<li>Impossible to know which files are installed</li>
<li>Impossible get information about the installed package like name, version, description, etc...<br /></li>
<li>Impossible to share the application with another installation of NuTyX</li>
<li>This method is quiete heavy because need to be done again when they will be an update available for example.</li>
<li>Your NuTyX is not really clean anymore since you have add files that are not track by the package manager.<br /></li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NuTyX have nice tools to help you greatly the integration of new programs. You will be then able to track them, maintain them. The package manager will treat them like other NuTyX packages.</p></div>
